## 1. Signage and Visual Information (466 responses)

The most dominant theme, representing over half of all feedback, focusing on various aspects of signage and visual information display throughout the Circle Line system.

### Sub-themes:
- **Exit Signage and Information** (70 responses)
- **Maps and Visual Displays** (99 responses)
- **Colors and Visual Design** (69 responses)
- **Information Clarity/Simplicity** (106 responses)

### Representative Examples:

1. "Exit signage should have text to label major destinations and not just the exit number"
2. "Please have exit directories at platform level, especially for stations where the two escalators from platform to concourse head in different directions"
3. "Improve signage for clearly distinguishing escalators to change platform from exiting the station"
4. "Retrofitting the C830, C830C, and C851E models with LED screens akin to those on the C751A trains on the NEL would significantly enhance the travel experience"
5. "Please use a simple icon for AC/ACW for every opportunity you have it will help a lot!"
6. "Find a clearer naming system in replacement of inner and outer loop, more Visuals for elderly, students and tourists"
7. "As mentioned earlier, wayfinding displays should be installed at every pathway intersections, more important for larger interchange stations with complicated platform locations"
8. "I find the platform id and exit id confusing. The new signs are sometimes so minimalist that they don't provide enough information"
9. "Use of colour around and improve the colour constraint of the background and font. It is hardly visible"
10. "The signs while striving to be as clear and simple as possible, should avoid making assumptions on what commuters know"

## 2. Loop Service Terminology (135 responses)

The second largest theme focuses on concerns about the naming conventions used for the loop services, particularly regarding the terms "inner loop" and "outer loop" versus "clockwise" and "anticlockwise."

### Sub-themes:
- **Prefer Clockwise/Anticlockwise** (14 responses)
- **Prefer Inner/Outer** (18 responses)
- **Against Inner/Outer** (28 responses)

### Representative Examples:

1. "Don't use outer loop and inner loop please. Clock wise or anti clockwise is better, and having appropriate instruction at each stop is the best"
2. "We should rename it to clockwise and anti-clockwise loops. Inner and outer is extremely confusing to anyone who is taking this for the first time"
3. "The inner and outer loop naming model is not intuitive. The concerns for children not understanding clockwise and anti-clockwise is unfounded"
4. "i think most critical is the naming of the loop services - as concise and minimal as possible would be best in my opinion"
5. "Please use Clockwise and Counterclockwise! It's a lot clearer for tourists!"
6. "inner and outer circles are very confusing"
7. "It needs to be clear which loop is faster for the further stations. Learn from the Yamanote line"
8. "Please seriously consider Clockwise or AntiClockwise as it is more intuitive than inner/outer loop"
9. "Please drop the inner/outer loop naming, very confusing. Clockwise/anticlockwise works much better"
10. "Less wording, don't use too complicated word: inner outer loop. It's hard to understand"

## 3. Transfer and Navigation Experience (58 responses)

This theme contains feedback about the overall navigation experience with emphasis on transfers between lines and platforms.

### Representative Examples:

1. "Whatever options decided in the end, as long as they are all consistent across the different wayfinding paths, then it's good :)"
2. "Instead of putting toward < next interchange >, < next station > seems to be better"
3. "TEL wayfinding is a no go. So much information missing"
4. "Better wayfinding for edge users e.g. non-English speakers"
5. "Audio announcements on the platform can be improved to indicate next two-three interchange stations"
6. "clearer announcements and maybe announcements specific to platform like TEL"
7. "It's not just the Circle Line, but the entire public transit network of Singapore whose wayfinding and branding needs to be improved"
8. "Use the platform caplet consistently"
9. "There are many other things to be changed. Good luck with deciding and dealing with feedback"
10. "For platforms with alternate train services, include on the train where the train is headed to"

## 4. Accessibility and User Experience (38 responses)

This theme focuses on how wayfinding affects different user groups, particularly those with special needs or limited familiarity with the system.

### Sub-themes:
- **Elderly and Senior Needs** (12 responses)
- **Tourist and Foreign Visitor Experience** (11 responses)
- **Disability Access** (1 response)

### Representative Examples:

1. "Too complicated and confusing"
2. "Consider the needs of infrequent travelers, tourists and the elderly, if they find it useful, so will frequent travelers"
3. "Seniors and commuters who do not ride the circle line frequently may still be lost at the start"
4. "Floor stickers may be helpful. Brighter areas during nighttime for seniors with poor vision"
5. "The stations should really be renumbered to indicate the stations on the main circle as CC to avoid confusion"
6. "Remove the branching. It makes things additionally confusing"
7. "Clear indication of Passenger Service to provide timely assistance to uncertain travelers"
8. "Very important point is the isometric. Target audience is elderly, tourists, and accessible persons"
9. "Bear in mind that elderly will be using the circle line and retaining as much design language as possible"
10. "Please keep in mind that elderly and tourist won't know everything. There should be legend at various places in train stations"

## 5. Digital and Technological Solutions (14 responses)

This theme covers suggestions for digital and technology-based improvements to the wayfinding system.

### Representative Examples:

1. "Bigger and more detailed signposting"
2. "The information presented are often small and particular difficult to read from a distance"
3. "Update the shade of the Circle Line to be of a darker shade of orange"
4. "Every stations can be applied with this"
5. "Might have to plan for train disruption because it is going one heck of a chaos when that happen"

### Representative Examples:

1. "Please follow London's underground system design that is meant for the illiterate and non-English speakers"
2. "Perhaps allow the speakers to detect if it needs to loosen itself. The trains are known for being very loud"

10. "Thank you for engaging the commuters to receive and hear the feedback"

## 7. Multilingual and Language Clarity (9 responses)

This theme includes suggestions for multiple languages or enhanced clarity to support wayfinding experiences.

### Representative Examples:

1. "Larger font for readability, include other national languages"
2. "Add text / description explaining the faded stations indicate longer travel time"
3. "more pictograms should be put in place for those who may struggle with english or small characters"
4. "Slightly messy in terms of design language where formatting and emphasis on different info types can be improved"
5. "More text less numbers and abbreviations"
6. "i think that getting foreigners to feedback will be great since we singaporeans are more or less use to the system"
7. "Support multiple languages"
8. "Continue to do surveys to garner feedback on other aspects of design language"
9. "the anouccment can add another language about the next station"

## Key Insights

1. **Terminology Controversy**: There is significant contention around the "inner loop" and "outer loop" terminology, with many respondents finding these terms confusing and non-intuitive. Many respondents explicitly prefer "clockwise" and "anticlockwise" as more universally understood alternatives.

2. **Signage Balance**: Respondents frequently mention the need to balance information density—providing enough information to be useful without overwhelming users with too much detail.

3. **Inclusive Design**: Multiple comments highlight the importance of considering the needs of elderly users, tourists, and non-English speakers in the wayfinding system design.

4. **Exit Information**: There is strong feedback that exit signage should include information about nearby landmarks or streets, not just exit numbers.

5. **Consistency**: Many respondents emphasize the importance of consistency across different parts of the transit system for easier navigation.

6. **Technology Upgrades**: Several suggestions involve upgrading display technologies, particularly implementing LED or LCD displays instead of static maps.

7. **Visual Clarity**: Comments about color contrast, font size, and visibility indicate concerns about the readability of information, especially from a distance or for those with visual impairments.
